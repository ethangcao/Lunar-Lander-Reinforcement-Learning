# Experiments for Lunar Lander Environment

## Abstract
Gym library in Python provides different environments for developing reinforcement learning algorithms. Lunar Lander environmentâ€™s goal is to land the lander on the landing pad by taken action to control the lander. The experiments in this paper are conducted based on discretized states with Q-Learning and Deep Q Network (DQN).

## Result
After fine-tuning:
Discretized states with Q-Learning: 66% success landing
Deep Q Network (DQN): 99% success landing

## Running the Code
### Required Python Packages
gym, numpy, pandas, random, torch, matplotlib, time
### Functions
